# SmarterCity
## An AI-Driven Sustainable City Planning!!

### Goal: Develop a cloud-powered platform to analyze urban data, predict trends, and optimize smart city solutions focusing on sustainability.
### Scope:
- Urban Data Analysis: Analyze city data such as traffic flow, population density, energy usage, and environmental metrics.
- Predictive Modeling: Predict future urban development trends and potential challenges like traffic congestion, waste accumulation, and energy needs.
- Smart City Solutions: AI-powered solutions to enhance smart transportation, waste management, and energy optimization.
- User Authentication: Ensure secure access to city data using Auth0.

### Technology Requirements
1. Gemini API: For generating insights from urban data using generative AI.
2. MongoDB: Storage for structured and unstructured city data (traffic patterns, energy consumption, etc.).
3. Colab: Data processing and predictive analytics.
4. Auth0: Secure and manage user authentication and roles.
